# Udacity DSND Project 1 - Salary for developers
---
This project uses datas from a poll of stackoverflow in 2017 in order to find some relationship between salary and other features, especially for developer and students. To notice that this project is a practice of data analysis assigned by Udacity DSND program and it would require a lot of improvement.

Here are the libraries needed in this project: 

- pandas 
- numpy 
- matplotlib 
- zipfile
- sklearn
- seaborn 
- random
- warnings
- time

# Project Motivation
---
Here are questions we would like to explore: 

1. How a high-salary developer looks like and what features they would have? 
2. What kind of student would expect a higher salary? 
3. Combining the two question, we would like to know whether a student could earn his/her expected salary or just to be optimistic? 

# File Descriptions
---
There are only 1 jupyter notebook file, which includes all the data wrangling part, the modelling building and the analysis to the three questions above. 

# Results
---
The main observation is posted in the blog. To see: [here](https://medium.com/@rtyjklcry/an-analysis-of-salary-for-developers-and-potential-developers-bc5bc4c3d405)
